# semantic-similarity

When I was first learning about machine learning, I wanted to implement a neural network from scratch without using high-level libraries such as Tensorflow. This is my attempt (as part of a school project).

The recurrent neural network architecture is loosely based on https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/SanbornAdrian.pdf with some minor modifications. The objective is to determine the semantic similarity between two sentences using GloVe word vectors as inputs.
