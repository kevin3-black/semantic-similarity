# semantic-similarity

A machine learning beginner's first attempt at creating a neural network from scratch in NumPy.

The recurrent neural network architecture is loosely based on https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/SanbornAdrian.pdf with some minor modifications. The objective of the network is to determine the semantic similarity between two sentences using GloVe word vectors as inputs.
